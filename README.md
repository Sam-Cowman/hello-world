This repository will be for practicing GitHub flow 
I am a new coding student learning to get a better understanding of web development. This repository is to get a better understanding of GitHub flow on the GitHub page instead of in CLI.  I will continue to practice GitHub flow in both GitHub and with the CLI commands.
